# TM8 Task Execution Plan

## 🎯 Overview
This document outlines the optimal execution order for TM8 development tasks, indicating which can be parallelized and which have dependencies.

## 📋 Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Sequential)
**Must be completed in order before other phases can begin.**

```
01-project-setup.md
└── Dependencies: None
└── Duration: ~1 hour
└── Deliverables: Directory structure, package.json, CSS variables
```

```
02-core-types.md
└── Dependencies: Task 01 (directory structure)
└── Duration: ~1 hour
└── Deliverables: TypeScript interfaces and enums
```

**⏱️ Phase 1 Total: ~2 hours**

---

### Phase 2: Core Systems (Parallel Execution)
**All tasks in this phase can run simultaneously after Phase 1 completes.**

#### Track A: Rendering Engine
```
03-webgl-canvas-engine.md
└── Dependencies: Task 02 (types)
└── Duration: ~4-6 hours
└── Agent Focus: WebGL, shaders, performance optimization
```

#### Track B: Data Processing
```
04-tm7-parser.md
└── Dependencies: Task 02 (types)
└── Duration: ~3-4 hours
└── Agent Focus: XML parsing, data transformation
```

#### Track C: Data Structures
```
05-graph-data-structures.md

---

### Phase 3: Integration & Features (Mixed Parallel/Sequential)

#### Track A: Canvas Integration (Sequential after Phase 2A + 2C)
```
07-canvas-integration.md
└── Dependencies: Task 03 (WebGL engine) + Task 05 (graph structures)
└── Duration: ~3-4 hours
└── Agent Focus: React + WebGL integration
```

#### Track B: UI Features (Parallel after Phase 2D)
Can run in parallel with Track A:

```
08-toolbar-tools.md

└── Duration: ~3-4 hours
└── Agent Focus: Tools, keyboard shortcuts
```

```

└── Dependencies: Task 04 (TM7 parser) + Task 06 (UI components)
└── Duration: ~2-3 hours
└── Agent Focus: File I/O, auto-save, drag & drop
```

**⏱️ Phase 3 Total: ~4 hours (mixed parallel execution)**

---

### Phase 4: Final Integration (Sequential)
**Must wait for all previous tasks to complete.**

```
12-final-integration.md
└── Dependencies: ALL previous tasks (01-11)
└── Duration: ~3-4 hours
└── Agent Focus: Integration, testing, optimization
```

**⏱️ Phase 4 Total: ~4 hours**

---

## 🚀 Optimal Parallel Execution Strategy

### Single Agent (Sequential): ~20-24 hours total
Execute tasks in numerical order: 01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06 → 07 → 08 → 09 → 10 → 11 → 12

### Two Agents: ~14-16 hours total
- **Agent 1**: Tasks 01 → 02 → 03 → 07 → 12 (foundation + rendering)
- **Agent 2**: Tasks 06 → 08 → 09 → 10 → 11 (UI + features)

### Three Agents: ~12-14 hours total
- **Agent 1**: Tasks 01 → 02 → 03 → 07 (foundation + rendering)
- **Agent 2**: Tasks 06 → 08 → 09 (UI components + tools)
- **Agent 3**: Tasks 04 → 05 → 10 → 11 (data processing + features)

### Four Agents: ~10-12 hours total
- **Agent 1**: Tasks 01 → 02 → 03 → 07 (foundation + rendering)
- **Agent 2**: Tasks 06 → 08 → 09 (UI components + tools)
- **Agent 3**: Tasks 04 → 11 (data parsing + file ops)
- **Agent 4**: Tasks 05 → 10 (graph structures + search)

## 📋 Agent Assignment Prompts

### Agent 1 (Foundation + Rendering)
```
You are the Foundation & Rendering Agent for TM8 development.

Your tasks in order:
1. Execute task 01-project-setup.md
2. Execute task 02-core-types.md
3. Execute task 03-webgl-canvas-engine.md
4. Wait for Agent 3 to complete task 05, then execute task 07-canvas-integration.md

## 🔄 Communication Protocols

### Dependency Notifications
When completing a task, announce completion:
```
[AGENT_NAME] COMPLETED: Task [XX] - [TASK_NAME]
Dependencies now available for: [LIST_OF_DEPENDENT_TASKS]
```

### Integration Points
Key files that multiple agents will modify:
- `src/App.tsx` (final integration in task 12)
- `src/core/types/index.ts` (task 02, extended by others)
- CSS variables in `src/styles/globals.css` (task 01, used by task 06)

### Testing Coordination
- Each agent tests their components independently
- Task 12 performs full integration testing
- Use sample files for validation: `samples/simple.tm7`, `samples/aws-example.tm7`, `samples/big.tm7`

---

## ⚠️ Critical Path & Blockers

### Critical Path (longest dependency chain):
Task 01 → Task 02 → Task 03 → Task 07 → Task 12
**Duration: ~11-13 hours**

### Potential Blockers:
1. **Task 03 (WebGL Engine)** - Most complex, could delay canvas integration
2. **Task 05 (Graph Structures)** - Required by search and canvas integration
3. **Task 02 (Core Types)** - Blocks almost everything else

### Risk Mitigation:
- Prioritize critical path tasks
- Have backup agent available for Task 03 if needed
- Start with simple implementations, optimize later
- Use mock data for testing if dependencies are delayed

## 🏁 Success Criteria

### Phase Completion Gates:
- **Phase 1**: Project builds, types compile
- **Phase 2**: Core systems work independently
- **Phase 3**: Features integrate with core systems
- **Phase 4**: Full application works end-to-end

### Final Validation:
- Load `samples/big.tm7` in <2 seconds
- Smooth interactions at 60 FPS
- All keyboard shortcuts work
- Export/import preserves data integrity
- No memory leaks or console errors
